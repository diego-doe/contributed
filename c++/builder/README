Protein Builder README
----------------------

g++ -o builder builder.cpp -I/usr/local/include/openbabel-2.0 -L/usr/local/lib -lopenbabel

./builder "Ala-Gly-Ser-Ala-Val" >test.cml
avogadro test.cml

That's it. At the moment, the builder is set for straight-chain oligopeptides.
But the code (in theory) should be set for helix, sheet, etc.

TODO
----
* Check phi/psi/omega values to be sure sign is correct (e.g., -60/-45 => helix)
* Check OBResidue data is setup properly for PDB export
* Provide better bonding information in the zmat files.
* Provide mechanism to change N and C terminus modifications.
